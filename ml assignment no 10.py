# 1. **Bayesian Interpretation of Probability**: In the Bayesian interpretation, probability is a measure of our belief or degree of confidence in an event or outcome. It represents our subjective uncertainty about the true state of affairs and can be updated as new evidence becomes available. Bayes' theorem is used to update probabilities based on prior beliefs and observed data.

# 2. **Probability of the Union of Two Events**: The probability of the union of two events, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is the probability that either event A or event B (or both) will occur. The formula is:
#    
#    P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

# 3. **Joint Probability**: Joint probability is the probability that two or more events occur simultaneously. For two events A and B, it is denoted as P(A and B) or P(A ∩ B). The formula for joint probability is:
# 
#    P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A) [Probability of A and then B]

# 4. **Chain Rule of Probability**: The chain rule allows the calculation of the joint probability of multiple events by breaking it down into conditional probabilities. For three events A, B, and C, it is expressed as:
# 
#    P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(C|A ∩ B)

# 5. **Conditional Probability**: Conditional probability represents the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B. The formula is:
# 
#    P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

# 6. **Continuous Random Variables**: Continuous random variables are variables that can take on any real value within a specified range. They are associated with continuous probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, and often represent measurements or quantities with infinite possible values (e.g., height, weight, temperature).

# 7. **Bernoulli Distribution**: The Bernoulli distribution models a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0). It is characterized by a parameter p, which represents the probability of success. The formula for the probability mass function (PMF) is:
#    
#    P(X = x) = p^x * (1 - p)^(1 - x) for x = 0 or 1

# 8. **Binomial Distribution**: The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is characterized by two parameters: n (the number of trials) and p (the probability of success in each trial). The formula for the PMF is:
# 
#    P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)

# 9. **Poisson Distribution**: The Poisson distribution models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space when the events are rare and independent. It is characterized by a parameter λ (lambda), which represents the average rate of occurrence. The formula for the PMF is:
# 
#    P(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!

# 10. **Covariance**: Covariance measures the degree to which two random variables change together. It indicates whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in another. The formula for the covariance between two random variables X and Y is:
# 
#     Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X]) * (Y - E[Y])]

# 11. **Correlation**: Correlation is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two random variables. It provides information about both the strength and direction of the relationship. The formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient between two random variables X and Y is:
# 
#     ρ(X, Y) = Cov(X, Y) / (σ(X) * σ(Y))

# 12. **Sampling with Replacement**: Sampling with replacement is a method where each item selected from a population is put back into the population before the next selection. This means that the same item can be selected more than once. Example: Drawing balls from a jar, putting the drawn ball back in before the next draw.

# 13. **Sampling without Replacement**: Sampling without replacement is a method where each item selected from a population is not returned to the population before the next selection. This ensures that each item can be selected only once. Example: Drawing cards from a deck without putting them back in.

# 14. **Hypothesis**: In statistics and science, a hypothesis is a statement or educated guess about a phenomenon or relationship between variables that can be tested and evaluated through experimentation or data analysis. It serves as a starting point for investigation and is often formulated as a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha). The null hypothesis typically represents the absence of an effect or relationship, while the alternative hypothesis suggests the presence of a specific effect or relationship to be tested.
